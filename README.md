### ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed
* Git installed

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omar-Alaa-Eldin/Finance.git
    cd Finance
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    Create a new SQLite database named `finance.db`. You can do this by running a simple command from the `cs50` library:
    ```bash
    flask run
    # This will likely create the database file if it doesn't exist. You might need to add a "users" and "transactions" table manually first.
    ```
    Alternatively, you can create the tables manually using SQL. Here are the schemas:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
        username TEXT NOT NULL,
        hash TEXT NOT NULL,
        cash NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 10000.00
    );

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
        user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
        shares INTEGER NOT NULL,
        price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
        transacted DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
